# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
  - This dataset was curated explicitly for research and experimentation within the field of Bayesian Optimization, a domain within machine learning that focuses on optimizing objective functions that are costly to evaluate.

- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?
  - The dataset provided by Imperial College London, comprising 8 distinct functions designed to simulate real-world scenarios. 

- Who funded the creation of the dataset?
  - The dataset was assembled by a team of researchers at the Imperial Business School, with the primary aim of facilitating research in optimisation techniques.



## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? 
  - The dataset is comprised of numerical data, meticulously structured to support the intricacies of Bayesian Optimization algorithms.

- How many instances of each type are there? 
  - The dataset encompasses a collection of 8 distinct datasets, each designed to challenge and evaluate optimization strategies under various conditions.

- Is there any missing data?
  - The dataset has been carefully curated to ensure completeness, with no instances of missing data, thus ensuring reliability and consistency in experimentation.

- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
  - There is no inclusion of confidential or sensitive data within this dataset, making it ethically sound and suitable for public research endeavors.


## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
  - he dataset was synthesized through computational methods, ensuring a high degree of control over the data characteristics relevant to Bayesian Optimization experiments.

- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
  - Each dataset within the collection was designed to represent a broad spectrum of scenarios encountered in optimization tasks, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation framework.

- Over what time frame was the data collected?
  - Ensure. 


## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
  - Ensure. 

- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
  - Ensure. 


## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
  - Beyond its primary purpose for Bayesian Optimization, this dataset holds the potential for exploring a variety of statistical modeling and machine learning methods, offering a valuable resource for the research community.

- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
  - No. 

- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
  - No. 


## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
  - The dataset has been made accessible through the Imperial Business School's platforms, aligning with its commitment to fostering open and collaborative research environments.

- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
  - Researchers interested in utilizing this dataset are advised to consult the Imperial Business School's guidelines to ensure compliance with any applicable intellectual property rights and terms of use.


## Maintenance

- Who maintains the dataset?
  - As of the current stage, there is no formal maintenance plan for the dataset. Researchers utilizing this dataset are encouraged to contribute to its evolution by sharing insights, updates, and improvements that may arise from their work.
